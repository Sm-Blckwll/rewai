                        <h2>What is Rewilding?</h2>
                        <p>Rewilding is a progressive approach to conservation. It‚Äôs about letting nature take care of
                            itself, enabling natural processes to shape land and sea, repair damaged ecosystems and
                            restore degraded landscapes. Through rewilding, wildlife‚Äôs natural rhythms create wilder,
                            more biodiverse habitats.</p>

                        <h2>Why Rewild?</h2>
                        <p>Our planet is in crisis. We‚Äôre facing a climate emergency, and one million species are at
                            risk of extinction. We need to act now to reverse the damage and restore nature. Rewilding
                            offers hope for the future, for wildlife and for us.</p>

                        <h2>How to Rewild?</h2>
                        <p>There are many ways to rewild. It can be as simple as letting your garden grow wild, or as
                            ambitious as reintroducing lost species to a whole landscape. Rewilding can be done anywhere
                            ‚Äì from gardens and farms to entire regions. It‚Äôs about working with nature, not against it.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Common misconceptions...</h2>
                        <p>There are many misconceptions about rewilding. It‚Äôs not about abandoning the countryside or
                            leaving it to run wild. It‚Äôs not about reintroducing dangerous predators or taking land out
                            of production. And it‚Äôs not about stopping people from enjoying the countryside. Rewilding
                            is about making space for nature to come back.</p>

                            resilience. Here are some key reasons to prioritize native species:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Biodiversity Support:</strong> Native plants provide habitats and food sources
                                for a diverse range of wildlife, including insects, birds, and mammals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ecosystem Resilience:</strong> Native plants have evolved alongside local pests
                                and diseases, contributing to the resilience of ecosystems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conservation of Unique Species:</strong> By choosing native plants, you actively
                                participate in the conservation of indigenous plant species that are often unique to
                                specific regions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adaptation to Local Conditions:</strong> Native plants are naturally adapted to
                                local climates, soil types, and other environmental factors, making them well-suited to
                                thrive in their native habitats.</li>
                            <li><strong>Support for Pollinators:</strong> Native plants play a crucial role in
                                supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the overall health

                        <p>When considering using carbon sequestration to change how we use land, there are important
                            things to think about. First, we need to make sure the methods we choose are effective and
                            will keep storing carbon for the long haul. It's also crucial to look at how these changes
                            might affect the environment overall, as well as things like farming and the people who live
                            nearby.</p>
                        <p> We have to make sure our policies support these changes and deal with challenges like making
                            sure we're actually storing carbon and not just moving it around. Lastly, we should think
                            about how these changes can help us with other environmental goals and make sure they help
                            ecosystems adapt to changes like climate change.</p>

                            <h2>Step one</h2>
                            <p>Start by finding you target location then clicking on the polygon button on the left
                                inside the map window.</p>
                            <h2>Step two</h2>
                            <p>Draw around the target area on the map, clicking to place each point. The further you
                                zoom in, the more accurate the calculation will be. When you are done, click the first
                                point again or double click on the map.</p>
                            <h2>Step three</h2>
                            <p>Select the current landuse type from the first drop-down selector, now select the new
                                landuse type from the second drop-down selector. You will see some new information, the
                                total area of the drawn shape, the current & new amounts of carbon sequested per year,
                                and the difference.</p>
                            <h2>Step four</h2>
                            <p>Once happy with your choices, press save to keep the area on the map for this session
                                (reloading the page will clear your saved areas). The area will show as a tooltip when
                                hovering over, and it will save in the colour of the landuse type.</p>

                        <h2>Considerations</h2>
                        <p>When considering using carbon sequestration to change how we use land, there are important
                            things to think about. First, we need to make sure the methods we choose are effective and
                            will keep storing carbon for the long haul. It's also crucial to look at how these changes
                            might affect the environment overall, as well as things like farming and the people who live
                            nearby.</p>
                        <p> We have to make sure our policies support these changes and deal with challenges like making
                            sure we're actually storing carbon and not just moving it around. Lastly, we should think
                            about how these changes can help us with other environmental goals and make sure they help
                            ecosystems adapt to changes like climate change.</p>

                        <p>If you really need to print out one of our guides, here are the links. However, you are going to have to pay for the privilege. Printing harms the environment through tree harvesting, water and energy consumption, waste generation, and chemical ink usage.<b>This leads to deforestation, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, landfill overflow, and health risks from toxins.</b> Shifting to digital alternatives and sustainable printing practices is essential to mitigate these impacts.</p>
